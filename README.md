&nbsp;
## Background

This assignment is designed to familiarize you with using pre-built CSS and JavaScript in your websites through a CSS framework. You will use [Twitter's Bootstrap framework](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/) for this assignment.

&nbsp;
## Setup

Created a git repository titled `m14-hw14-eastwood-josie` and cloned it to my computer. Then I copied the `index.html` file from the `unsolved` folder into the root directory of the repository.

&nbsp;
## Instructions Followed

- Added a **mobile-responsive navbar** that collapses on smaller screens and opens/closes using built-in Bootstrap JS functionality.
- Used the **Bootstrap responsive grid system** to layout content in responsive rows and columns.
- Applied **Bootstrap spacing utilities** (`mt-4`, `mb-3`, `p-3`, etc.) for margins and padding.
- Included at least **two other Bootstrap components**:
  - **Card** (for the About Me and Hobbies sections)
  - **Button** (for the Learn More section)

Minimal custom CSS was used (if any), and Bootstrap’s built-in classes handled layout and styling.

## Comments

No major issues. Bootstrap’s documentation was really helpful for learning how to quickly implement responsive layout and interactive components without writing custom JavaScript or CSS.
